3GPP 36.331 reviewing -- RRC protocol Specification
---------------------------------------------------

The RRC (Radio Resource Control) layer is the manager of the radio resource
and the main controlling protocol in the Access Stratum. It is responsible for
establishing the radio bearer and configuring the lower layers.  It is also
handling mobility related functions between the UE and the access network,
like handover and measurements, broadcasting system information and paging.


### 4 General


#### 4.1 Introduction

Preview entire organization of 36.331 specification, where *section 5* is the
essentials, which cover whole RRC signalling procedure. The *section 6, 7, 8*
specify which RRC messages is defined, what format they have, as well as how
to encode RRC messages.  It looks like dictionay used to query variable of RRC
messages.

[TODO] how about section 9, 10, 11?


#### 4.2 Architecture


##### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT

In LTE system, there're two RRC states: RRC_IDLE state, RRC_CONNECTED state.
But, notice that RRC_IDLE mode and RRC_CONNECTED mode are often used in some
books and articals. The difference between them is subtle, you can consider
them as same things in most cases, just for statement convenience.

**RRC_IDLE overview**

UE shall choose a appropriate Cell from a specific PLMN to camp after power
on. UE can receive system information and cell broadcast information. Usually,
UE shall perform register on the first power on, doing so, complete
authentication and authorization, on the other hand E-UTRAN acquire basic
information of UE. Thereafter, UE is in IDLE mode till RRC connection set up.

Camping on a cell, UE can do:

*   receive system information
*   initiate RRC connect request
*   receive paging message (E-UTRAN only learn which Track Area UE camp on)

Actually, UE has three states with further partition:

*   *NULL* state, enter the state immediately when powering on or can't
    find any camping cell.

*   *SEL* state, in order to find an appropriate camping cell, need to measure
    the specific cell or all cells within frequence band, decode BCH, receive
    system information till camping a cell and enter IDLE state.

*   *IDLE* state, UE have already camped a cell, so it can receive
    broadcast/multicast data, monitors a paging channel to detect incoming
    calls, performs neighbor cell measurements and cell selection/reselection
    and acquires system information. In addition, a UE specific DRX
    (discontinuous reception) cycle may be configured by NAS to enable UE
    power savings and mobility is controlled by the UE.


**RRC_IDLE procedure**

*   cell selection/reselection

*   monitor paging channel

*   receive system information

*   cell measurement

*   DRX control



**RRC_CONNECTED overview**

UE shall initiate state transition from RRC_IDLE state/mode to RRC_CONNECTED
state/mode, triggered by paging or NAS message, after sending RRC connection
request. Once set up RRC connection, i.e. set up DCCH logical channel (SRB),
transfer delicated control RRC message over DCCH, UE enter RRC_CONNECTED
state.

Entering RRC_CONNECTED status, UE can do:

*   receive/transimit data from/to E-UTRAN

*   monitor control channels associated with the shared data channel to
    determine if data is schedule

*   provides channel quality feedback information

*   performs neighbor cell measurements and measurement reporting

*   acquires system information

*   enable DRX, configured by E-UTRAN


Actually, UE has three states with further partition:

*   ACC, random access status. UE recieve connection setup request from
    upper level, notify MAC to initiate random access procedure through
    RRC primitive, then uplink sync is set up.

*   CON, normal connection status, which include the radio link procedure
    between UE and E-UTRAN, such as initial security activation, RRC
    connection reconfiguration, connection re-establishment, RRC connection
    release, etc.

*   HO, handover status, which perform intra-frequency, inter-frequency
    handover, the MobilityControlInfo of RRC connection reconfiguration is
    used for it.

**RRC_CONNECTED procedure**

*   setup/reconfig/release RRC connection
*   setup/reconfig/release SRB
*   security mode activation
*   HO
*   recovery for radio link failure
*   measure control and report
*   recieve system information
