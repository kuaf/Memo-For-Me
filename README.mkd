Memorandum For me
=================

I am not a wiseman, what's more, with bad memory. In the past few years, I
often forgot  many things. Here I recode them.

As for authoring and document organization, I was entangled with this problem
for a long time. The choice is below:

*   [MS Word][] vs [Plain Text][]?

    I like the philosophy *simple is beatutity*, Plain Text is preferred.

*   [Vim][] vs [Emacs][]?

    I don't want to provoke war between Vim and Emacs, both of them are powerful
    and perfect editor, stand for different philosophy and culture. I love both.
    Here Vim is preferred, since I have been working with Vim for many years,
    still not master it very well. I believe I can through practise. Also, I
    will try Emacs someday, it's just time issue.

*   [Markdown][] vs [Org-mode][]?

    I really like Org-mode - the life in plain text, which is for keeping notes,
    maintaining ToDo lists, doing project planning, and authoring with a fast
    and effective plain-text system. It's so crazy when I watched [Google Tech
    Talk about Emacs Org-mode][google org-mode]. I don't find perfect org-mode
    solution of Vim even though there're two projects woking on it, i.e.
    [VimOrganizer][] and [vim-orgmode][]. I will try them in the future, not
    now at least. Markdown is designed to be as readable as possible, intending
    for web publish. It has been supported in Vim community, mostly important,
    you're able to do some changes based on other folks' work easily. I want a
    big plain text recording verything, which means Markdown syntax need to
    define more than 6 heading levels. The corresponding Markdown-to-HTML tool
    also has to be tweaked. I'll resolve all of relevant issues in the future,
    not now. So far, Markdown file is organzied as per category, such as
    UMTS/LTE, CS, Codebase, E-learning, GTD, etc. [Pandoc][] is used for
    Markdown-to-HTML tool before I fully master [Markdown.pl][Markdown tool] 

Obviously, the ultimate conclusion is `Plain Text + Vim + Markdown`.

Last but not least, English writting is as preferable as possible. I hope to
improve my writing skills in English and reach more people than before.
